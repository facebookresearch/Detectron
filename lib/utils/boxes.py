"""Box manipulation functions. The internal Detectron box format is
[x1, y1, x2, y2] where (x1, y1) specify the top-left box corner and (x2, y2)
specify the bottom-right box corner. Boxes from external sources, e.g.,
datasets, may be in other formats (such as [x, y, w, h]) and require conversion.

This module uses a convention that may seem strange at first: the width of a box
is computed as x2 - x1 + 1 (likewise for height). The "+ 1" dates back to old
object detection days when the coordinates were integer pixel indices, rather
than floating point coordinates in a subpixel coordinate frame. A box with x2 =
x1 and y2 = y1 was taken to include a single pixel, having a width of 1, and
hence requiring the "+ 1". Now, most datasets will likely provide boxes with
floating point coordinates and the width should be more reasonably computed as
x2 - x1.

In practice, as long as a model is trained and tested with a consistent
convention either decision seems to be ok (at least in our experience on COCO).
Since we have a long history of training models with the "+ 1" convention, we
are reluctant to change it even if our modern tastes prefer not to use it.
